College Admission Q&A Bot

Project Overview
This project involves creating a chatbot, named AdmissionBot, to assist users with college admission-related queries. The bot is designed to answer questions about admission procedures, requirements, deadlines, and more.

Project Structure

The project is implemented using Python and the ChatterBot library. The main components include:

AdmissionBot Initialization:
The bot is created using ChatterBot, configured with the BestMatch logic adapter for response selection.

Training:
The bot is trained using both the ChatterBot English language corpus and custom admission-related data.

User Interaction:
Users are engaged in a conversation, allowing them to ask multiple questions in a single session.

Contextual Understanding:
The bot is enhanced to understand context by remembering information from previous interactions, providing more personalized responses.

Backend Integration:
There's an option to integrate the bot with a backend system to fetch real-time admission-related information.

Error Handling and Feedback:
Robust error handling is implemented for queries the bot cannot answer, providing helpful feedback to users.
